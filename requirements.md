# Project Requirements

Video Concept:

1. Message:
   "Welcome to the World's First Talent-Based Social Media Platform for Job Seekers!"
   Highlight that eqly.in is not just another platform but the place for Gen Z to thrive in their
   career journey.
2. Tone and Vibe:
   Make sure the visuals and music evoke a confident, "We have arrived!" feel—
   showcasing dynamic, fast-paced scenes that resonate with the Gen Z audience.
3. Optimized Experience:
   Since we want a fast load time, can replace heavy video files with high-definition static
   images, GIFs, or lightweight animations that still maintain the appeal. The experience
   should be seamless, immediate, and professional.
4. Call-to-Action (C2A):
   Use something like: "Join the Movement. Build Your Future, Today!" or "Ready to Level
   Up Your Career?" This should be front and center, with buttons that stand out.
5. Visuals:
   Use vibrant and modern colors (e.g., bold blues, energetic purples) to convey innovation.
   Focus on user-friendly, accessible fonts and design elements that highlight ease of use.

         for each section to make the content pop and feel fresh. These colors should transition
         seamlessly as users scroll.
          Typography: Bold and modern fonts like Poppins and Bebas Neue with dynamic size

         hovered over or clicked, ensuring a dynamic experience. These icons should represent
         each section and engage users.
          Call-to-Actions (CTAs): Ensure the CTAs stand out with vibrant buttons or text links,
         using bold colors and a modern design. Ensure these CTAs appear engaging, clear, and
         easy to navigate. Example CTA buttons: "Start Now," "Explore Jobs," "Grow Your
         Network."

          You can make changes the way we
         have discussed if you think it will
         work best

1. 1000+ Active Users
   Celebrate the success of our growing community. Over 1000 active users are already part
   of the eqly.in platform.
   o Visuals: Use vibrant, bold typography with a smooth gradient background (think
   dark blue to purple) to make it stand out. Add a slight animation or glowing effect
   to the number "1000+" to emphasize its growth.
1. 68.33% Active Users Joined Within a Week
   Our platform is growing rapidly, with more than 68% of users joining within their first
   week.
   o Visuals: Highlight this achievement with a dynamic graph or animated counter to
   give the feel of fast-paced growth. Use energetic colors like electric green or neon
   yellow for contrast, placed over dark gradients.
1. 1000+ Indian Users
   eqly.in has already made waves across India with over 1000 users.
   o Visuals: Use a map with glowing markers on India, highlighting the large user
   base in the country. The background can feature rich gradients like deep red and
   gold to represent success in India.
1. Top Companies Filling Exclusive Access Forms
   Leading companies are already recognizing the potential of eqly.in and have filled our
   exclusive access form.

   States.

   sophistication, with sleek animations to create a sense of movement.
   Design and Typography Suggestions:

   Slab, or Montserrat. Opt for bold fonts for the numbers and achievements to make them
   pop, and use elegant, thinner fonts for the descriptions.
    Colors & Gradients: Utilize rich colors that give a high-definition and premium feel,
   such as dark purples, golds, blues, and electric greens. Soft gradients will provide depth
   and sophistication to the content without making it too heavy.
    Animations: Incorporate animations like counters for the numbers (e.g., active users),
   smooth fades, and scroll-based animations to draw attention to each achievement. These
   animations should be subtle yet impactful, providing a seamless experience.
    Layout: The achievements should be presented in a clean, organized, and spacious grid
   format with plenty of white space around them. Each achievement can be displayed
   within a dynamic card or circular element with hover effects to engage users.

   subtext. Opt for large, bold typography for each achievement/feature to make it stand out.

   Use vibrant gradients like dark blue to neon green or gold to electric purple for
   backgrounds. Keep the text white for contrast. You can also consider subtle hover effects
   for CTA buttons.
    Icons & Logos:
   Choose modern, sleek icons (such as a dollar sign for "Get Paid to Create Content," a
   globe for "Access Global Opportunities," and a shining star or spotlight for "Access
   Premium Opportunities"). Make sure they're clean and minimalistic, with a slight
   animation to make them interactive.
    Layout:
   Consider a horizontal layout with large, bold headings at the top, followed by a short and
   punchy description. Place the corresponding icons next to each point for better
   engagement.

Refined Form Design

1. Overall Layout:
   o Minimalist Approach: Use a clean, sleek form layout with plenty of white space.
   Remove any unnecessary clutter and keep the focus on the essential fields.
   o Background: Use a soft gradient background (e.g., light purple to dark blue) to
   maintain an energetic yet elegant vibe.
   o Form Borders & Fields: Make sure the fields have smooth, rounded corners
   with a slight shadow effect to create a clean, modern look. The form sections
   should be clearly divided with enough space between them.
2. Form Fields:
   o Name: A simple text input field with a modern font like Roboto or Montserrat.
   o Email: Another text input field for email, with a sleek placeholder text like "Enter
   your email."
   o Status (Job Seeker, Currently Working, or Company Interest):
    Use a drop-down or radio buttons to select the status.
    Based on the status, show different MCQ questions (see below). The
   options could be:
    Job Seeker: "What challenges are you facing in finding your dream
   job?"
    Currently Working: "What is your current career challenge?"
    Company: "What are the difficulties you're facing in finding the
   right talent?"
   o Company Name (For Companies): A text field to fill in the company name,
   shown only if the user selects "Company Interest."
   o Additional Question (Based on Status): A dynamic, MCQ-based question that
   changes based on whether the user is a job seeker, employed, or representing a
   company. For example:
    Job Seeker: "What difficulties are you facing?"
    Options:
    A. Lack of relevant job opportunities
    B. Difficulty with interviews
    C. Limited professional network
    Currently Working: "What is your current career obstacle?"
    Options:
    A. Lack of career growth opportunities
    B. Unhappy with work-life balance
    C. Seeking new challenges
    Company: "What challenges are you facing in hiring the right talent?"
    Options:
    A. Lack of qualified candidates
    B. Poor engagement from potential applicants
    C. Hiring process inefficiencies
3. Buttons & Icons:
   o Submit Button: Use a bold, attention-grabbing button with text like "Get
   Exclusive Access" or "Join eqly Now!" in a vibrant color like neon green or
   electric blue. Add subtle hover animations to give it a dynamic feel.
   o Icons: Use sleek, simple icons next to each field (like a user icon for the name
   field, envelope for email, etc.), with a modern design. Use vibrant colors for the
   icons to keep things visually engaging.
4. Data Storage & Management:
   o Backend Storage: You can store the form submissions in a Google Sheets or
   Airtable integration (via N8N or another service) to easily track user data,
   depending on their status (job seeker, employed, company).
   o Personalization: Make sure the form questions are dynamically displayed based
   on the selected status. If needed, use a simple JavaScript function to show/hide
   the questions accordingly.
   o Email Notification: Set up an email notification system to alert your team
   whenever a new form is submitted, categorized by status.
   Aesthetic Enhancements:
    Fonts: Use bold, modern fonts like Montserrat or Poppins for the headings and form
   titles to create a youthful, energetic feel. Use a clean font like Roboto for form input
   fields to keep things easy to read.
    Colors: Use gradients and dynamic color schemes to draw attention, with contrasting
   buttons and text. For example, a gradient background from deep purple to neon pink can
   add richness, while buttons in bright greens or yellows make them pop.
    Animations: Implement smooth fade-in effects for the form fields and buttons. Also,
   consider animating the MCQ question transitions for a smooth, interactive experience.

## Bug Fixes

1. CSS Modules Pure Selector Issue

   - Problem: Bare `h1` selector in Hero.module.scss causing compilation error
   - Fix: Replaced bare `h1` selector with `.title` class and updated component to use the class
   - Impact: Resolved CSS Modules compilation error and maintained proper CSS scoping

2. Next.js Hydration Error

   - Problem: Server/client HTML mismatch due to random values in Hero component
   - Root Cause: `Math.random()` generating different values during server and client rendering
   - Fix:
     - Moved random value generation to useEffect hook
     - Implemented useState to manage star positions
     - Generated star data after component mount
     - Initial render now starts with empty stars array on both server and client
   - Impact: Resolved hydration error while maintaining the interactive star field effect

3. Performance Optimization
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders by moving star generation logic to useEffect
   - Improved memory management by cleaning up event listeners
   - Better state management for dynamic values
